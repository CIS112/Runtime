/******************************************************************************
* An IntArrayBag is a collection of int numbers.
* The same number may appear multiple times in a bag.

*
* @note
*   (1) The capacity of one of these bags can change after it's created, but
*   the maximum capacity is limited by the amount of free memory on the 
*   machine. The constructor, addItem, clone, 
*   and union will result in an OutOfMemoryError
*   when free memory is exhausted.
*   <p>
*   (2) A bag's capacity cannot exceed the maximum integer 2,147,483,647
*   (Integer.MAX_VALUE). Any attempt to create a larger capacity
*   results in a failure due to an arithmetic overflow. 
*   <p>
*   (3) Because of the slow linear algorithms of this
*   class, large bags will have poor performance.
